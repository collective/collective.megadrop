Known Issues

    * Currently jquery.megadrop.js only toggles the megahide class on and off.  It should allow
        navigation with mouse and keyboard of revealed list structure.
    * megadrop.css is minimal, displaying subtree <ul> structure in block format.
    * After displaying hidden divs, the <h2>'s in tab structure lose inline styling.
