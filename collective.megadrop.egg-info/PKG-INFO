        Known Issues
        
            * Currently jquery.megadrop.js only toggles the megahide class on and off.  It should allow
                navigation with mouse and keyboard of revealed list structure.
            * megadrop.css is minimal, displaying subtree <ul> structure in block format.
            * After displaying hidden divs, the <h2>'s in tab structure lose inline styling.
